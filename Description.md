## Data

Analysis of New York City crimes data: two possibilities, for which exist two main datasets [official open data sources](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/):

1) [arrests]( https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data)
2) [complaints](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i/about_data)

Both of them contain essential informations about each event (respectively 19 and 39 variables, some are reduntant): day and spatial coordinates, crime type classification, some perpetrator or suspect and victim key features (age group, sex and race).
Each dataset starts from 2006 and is updated annualy.
